## Banner

![YapBuddy banner](HBanner.png)

YapBuddy is a basic gui chatbot project for Windows. This early version is built for learning and experimenting with chatbot logic in Python.

---

## Features

- **Session memory**: Remembers messages only during your current session.
- **No persistent history**: All chat history is wiped when you close the app.
- **Message sender markers**: Distinguishes between user and bot messages.
- **Basic responses**: Handles simple interactions.

## Download options

There are 3 current options to download YapBuddy:

- **Installer :** You download one .exe file and and use it to install the app in the programs or a custom directory. Usually best for casual use
- **Portable :** You download one zipped folder in the .zip format made with all its extensions and supply , and you can unzip it at any given time and use right from there. Best for storing the app long term on a flash drive or just quick use.
- **Ultra-Portable :** A more compressed version than the portable using a .rar extension that provides a better compression protocol. Best for storing on low end external storage devices.

## How to Use

1. Download a build from the releases tab.
2. Double-click the `.exe` file.
3. Type your message and press Enter.

## Limitations

- Only remembers conversation context during your session.
- No chat history is saved between sessions.
- Replies are basic; complex interactions may not be handled.
- No animation yet.
- Slow first time start up.
- Occasional IO delay.

---

## Future Plans

- Add persistent memory for conversations.
- Improve response quality.
- Enable the bot to perform simple actions.
